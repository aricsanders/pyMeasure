    "pyMeasure is a python package born out of the daily needs of a laboratory scientist. In particular, there is a constant need to use external equipment to acquire data, store that data in a sensible way, analyze the stored data, and generate collections and reports after analyzing the data. In the world of scientific computation there is an endless universe of solutions to do this, however none of the solutions met my personal daily needs and philosophy simultaneously. This package tries to stitch together many tools to meet those needs, while serving as a backend library to a webserver. It thus has a lot of other packages. It relies on these packages in different ways and may operate differently on different oeprating systems.Although it currently has a single primary developer, it is my hope that it will be adopted by at least 10's of people and help them accomplish their daily scientific goals."

    "\n",
    "### Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Infrastructure\n",
    "pyMeasure has a multi-tiered testing infrastructure. It is comprised of basic unit tests, mesoscopic in module tests, and integration tests. \n",
    "1. __Unit tests :__ These tests check if functions and classes with a basic input return what is expected. They are found in the module pyMeasure.Code.Utils.pyMeasureUnitTests\n",
    "2. __In Module Tests :__ Theses tests are scripts included in each module that test a series of things about functions or classes, they are typically named test_thing_of_interest()\n",
    "3. __Integration Tests:__ These tests check if a large number of interacting components work as expected. For the wx frontend this is primarily the class AdvancedInterfaceFrame, or an integrated application that can open new window panels, run the in module tests and check if data objects appear as they are expected.\n",
